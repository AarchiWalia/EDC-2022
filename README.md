## Setup Flask Server Locally
   Make sure you have Python and pip installed before proceeding further.
   - Setup a virtual Environment, we have used venv for the same

   $ python -m venv env
   $ source env/scripts/activate (for mac/linux/gitbash) 
   ```
   - Install all dependencies (within the virtual environment)
